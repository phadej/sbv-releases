-- Stability : experimental

-- Puzzle:
--
--    You are standing in front of three rooms and must choose one. In one room is a Lady
--    (whom you could and wish to marry), in the other two rooms are tigers (that if you
--    choose either of these rooms, the tiger invites you to breakfast – the problem is
--    that you are the main course). Your job is to choose the room with the Lady.
--    The signs on the doors are:
--
--         * A Tiger is in this room
--         * A Lady is in this room
--         * A Tiger is in room two
--
--    At most only 1 statement is true. Where’s the Lady?

-- | Prints the only solution:
--
-- >>> ladyAndTigers
-- Solution #1:
--   sign1  = False :: Bool
--   sign2  = False :: Bool
--   sign3  =  True :: Bool
--   tiger1 = False :: Bool
--   tiger2 =  True :: Bool
--   tiger3 =  True :: Bool
-- This is the only solution.
--
-- That is, the lady is in room 1, and only the third room's sign is true.
