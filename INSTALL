The sbv library can be installed simply by issuing cabal install
like this:

     cabal install sbv

Once the installation is done, you will get the Data.SBV library.
The installation will also put a binary named

     SBVUnitTests

in your .cabal/bin directory (or wherever you installed it.) It's
highly recommended that you run this program to ensure everything
is working correctly. In particular, you will first need to install
Z3, the default SMT solver used by sbv, from Microsoft. (You can get it
from http://github.com/Z3Prover/z3.)
Please make sure that the "z3" executable is in your path.

Once you have installed sbv, you can use it in your Haskell programs
by simply importing the Data.SBV module.
