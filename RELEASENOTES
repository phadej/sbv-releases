======================================================================
Version 0.9.24, 2011-12-28

  Library:
   * Add "forSome," analogous to "forAll." (The name "exists" would've
     been better, but it's already taken.) This is not as useful as
     one might think as forAll and forSome do not nest, as an inner
     application of one pushes its argument to a Predicate, making
     the outer one useless, but it's nonetheless useful by itself.
   * Add a "Modelable" class, which simplifies model extraction.
   * Add support for quick-check at the "Symbolic SBool" level. Previously
     SBV only allowed functions returning SBool to be quick-checked, which
     forced a certain style of coding. In particular with the addition
     of quantifiers, the new coding style mostly puts the top-level
     expressions in the Symbolic monad, which were not quick-checkable
     before. With new support, the quickCheck, prove, sat, and allSat
     commands are all interchangeable with obvious meanings.
   * Add support for concrete test case generation, see the genTest function.
   * Improve optimize routines and add support for iterative optimization.
   * Add "constrain", simplifying conjunctive constraints, especially
     useful for adding constraints at variable generation time via
     forall/exists. Note that the interpretation of such constraints
     is different for genTest and quickCheck functions, where constraints
     will be used for appropriately filtering acceptable test values
     in those two cases.
   * Add "pConstrain", which probabilistically adds constraints. This
     is useful for quickCheck and genTest functions for filtering acceptable
     test values. (Calls to pConstrain will be rejected for sat/prove calls.)
   * Add "isVacuous" which can be used to check that the constraints added
     via constrain are satisfable. This is useful to prevent vacuous passes,
     i.e., when a proof is not just passing because the constraints imposed
     are inconsistent. (Also added accompanying isVacuousWith.)
   * Add "free" and "free_", analogous to "forall/forall_" and "exists/exists_"
     The difference is that free behaves universally in a proof context, while
     it behaves existentially in a sat context. This allows us to express
     properties more succinctly, since the intended semantics is usually this
     way depending on the context. (i.e., in a proof, we want our variables
     universal, in a sat call existential.) Of course, exists/forall are still
     available when mixed quantifiers are needed, or when the user wants to
     be explicit about the quantifiers.
  Examples
   * Add Data/SBV/Examples/Puzzles/Coins.hs. (Shows the usage of "constrain".)
  Dependencies
   * Bump up random package dependency to 1.0.1.1 (from 1.0.0.2)
  Internal
   * Major reorganization of files to and build infrastructure to
     decrease build times and better layout
   * Get rid of custom Setup.hs, just use simple build. The extra work
     was not worth the complexity.

======================================================================
Version 0.9.23, 2011-12-05
  
  Library:
   * Add support for SInteger, the type of signed unbounded integer
     values. SBV can now prove theorems about unbounded numbers,
     following the semantics of Haskell's Integer type. (Requires z3 to
     be used as the backend solver.)
   * Add functions 'optimize', 'maximize', and 'minimize' that can
     be used to find optimal solutions to given constraints with
     respect to a given cost function.
   * Add 'cgUninterpret', which simplifies code generation when we want
     to use an alternate definition in the target language (i.e., C). This
     is important for efficient code generation, when we want to
     take advantage of native libraries available in the target platform.
  Other:
   * Change getModel to return a tuple in the success case, where
     the first component is a boolean indicating whether the model
     is "potential." This is used to indicate that the solver
     actually returned "unknown" for the problem and the model
     might therefore be bogus. Note that we did not need this before
     since we only supported bounded bit-vectors, which has a decidable
     theory. With the addition of unbounded Integer's and quantifiers, the
     solvers can now return unknown. This should still be rare in practice,
     but can happen with the use of non-linear constructs. (i.e.,
     multiplication of two variables.)

======================================================================
Version 0.9.22, 2011-11-13
   
  The major change in this release is the support for quantifiers. The
  SBV library *no* longer assumes all variables are universals in a proof,
  (and correspondingly existential in a sat) call. Instead, the user
  marks free-variables appropriately using forall/exists functions, and the
  solver translates them accordingly. Note that this is a non-backwards
  compatible change in sat calls, as the semantics of formulas is essentially
  changing. While this is unfortunate, it's more uniform and simpler to understand
  in general.

  This release also adds support for the Z3 solver, which is the main
  SMT-solver used for solving formulas involving quantifiers. More formally,
  we use the new AUFBV/ABV/UFBV logics when quantifiers are involved. Also, 
  the communication with Z3 is now done via SMT-Lib2 format. Eventually
  the SMTLib1 connection will be severed.

  The other main change is the support for C code generation with
  uninterpreted functions enabling users to interface with external
  C functions defined elsewhere. See below for details.

  Other changes:
    Code:
     * Change getModel, so it returns an Either value to indicate
       something went wrong; instead of throwing an error
     * Add support for computing CRCs directly (without needing
       polynomial division).
    Code generation:
     * Add "cgGenerateDriver" function, which can be used to turn
       on/off driver program generation. Default is to generate
       a driver. (Issue "cgGenerateDriver False" to skip the driver.)
       For a library, a driver will be generated if any of the
       constituent parts has a driver. Otherwise it'll be skipped.
     * Fix a bug in C code generation where "Not" over booleans were
       incorrectly getting translated due to need for masking.
     * Add support for compilation with uninterpreted functions. Users
       can now specify the corresponding C code and SBV will simply
       call the "native" functions instead of generating it. This
       enables interfacing with other C programs. See the functions:
       cgAddPrototype, cgAddDecl, and cgAddLDFlags.
    Examples:
     * Add CRC polynomial generation example via existentials
     * Add USB CRC code generation example, both via polynomials and
       using the internal CRC functionality

======================================================================
Version 0.9.21, 2011-08-05
   
   Code generation:
    * Allow for inclusion of user makefiles
    * Allow for CCFLAGS to be set by the user
    * Other minor clean-up

======================================================================
Version 0.9.20, 2011-06-05
   
    * Regression on 0.9.19; add missing file to cabal

======================================================================
Version 0.9.19, 2011-06-05
    
   Code:
    * Add SignCast class for conversion between signed/unsigned
      quantities for same-sized bit-vectors
    * Add full-binary trees that can be indexed symbolically (STree). The
      advantage of this type is that the reads and writes take
      logarithmic time. Suitable for implementing faster symbolic look-up.
    * Expose HasSignAndSize class through Data.SBV.Internals
    * Many minor improvements, file re-orgs
   Examples:
    * Add sentence-counting example
    * Add an implementation of RC4

======================================================================
Version 0.9.18, 2011-04-07

  Code:
    * Re-engineer code-generation, and compilation to C.
      In particular, allow arrays of inputs to be specified,
      both as function arguments and output reference values.
    * Add support for generation of generation of C-libraries,
      allowing code generation for a set of functions that
      work together.
  Examples:
    * Update code-generation examples to use the new API.
    * Include a library-generation example for doing 128-bit
      AES encryption

======================================================================
Version 0.9.17, 2011-03-29
   
  Code:
    * Simplify and reorganize the test suite
  Examples:
    * Improve AES decryption example, by using
      table-lookups in InvMixColumns.
  
======================================================================
Version 0.9.16, 2011-03-28

  Code:
    * Further optimizations on Bits instance of SBV
  Examples:
    * Add AES algorithm as an example, showing how
      encryption algorithms are particularly suitable
      for use with the code-generator

======================================================================
Version 0.9.15, 2011-03-24
   
  Bug fixes:
    * Fix rotateL/rotateR instances on concrete
      words. Previous versions was bogus since
      it relied on the Integer instance, which
      does the wrong thing after normalization.
    * Fix conversion of signed numbers from bits,
      previous version did not handle two's
      complement layout correctly
  Testing:
    * Add a sleuth of concrete test cases on
      arithmetic to catch bugs. (There are many
      of them, ~30K, but they run quickly.)

======================================================================
Version 0.9.14, 2011-03-19
    
  - Reimplement sharing using Stable names, inspired
    by the Data.Reify techniques. This avoids tricks
    with unsafe memory stashing, and hence is safe.
    Thus, issues with respect to CAFs are now resolved.

======================================================================
Version 0.9.13, 2011-03-16
    
  Bug fixes:
    * Make sure SBool short-cut evaluations are done
      as early as possible, as these help with coding
      recursion-depth based algorithms, when dealing
      with symbolic termination issues.
  Examples:
    * Add fibonacci code-generation example, original
      code by Lee Pike.
    * Add a GCD code-generation/verification example

======================================================================
Version 0.9.12, 2011-03-10
  
  New features:
    * Add support for compilation to C
    * Add a mechanism for offline saving of SMT-Lib files

  Bug fixes:
    * Output naming bug, reported by Josef Svenningsson
    * Specification bug in Legato's multipler example

======================================================================
Version 0.9.11, 2011-02-16
  
  * Make ghc-7.0 happy, minor re-org on the cabal file/Setup.hs

======================================================================
Version 0.9.10, 2011-02-15

  * Integrate commits from Iavor: Generalize SBV's to keep
    track the integer directly without resorting to different
    leaf types
  * Remove the unnecessary CLC instruction from the Legato example
  * More tests

======================================================================
